# Image-Classification-MobilenetV2
This project implements an image classification model using MobileNetV2, a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications. The model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over a million images across 1,000 categories, allowing it to recognize a wide variety of objects.
